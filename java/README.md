## Java Sample for Amazon Hub Counter API
This is a sample application that shows how to use the **amazon-hub-counter-sdk** module following the best practices for interacting with our API:

1. Creating or updating one or more Access Points.
2. Validating the data fields before submitting.
3. Submitting the Feed (the list of Access Points).
4. Store the returned Feed Id and keep logs of every action to help debugging.
5. Poll the API until the Feed processing is completed.
6. Fetch the Output Document and display and log any issues.

* The application logs information to the console output, and also more detailed information to a log file named amazon-counter-hub-api-cli.log.

### How to run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run:
```cd java/```

### FAQ
##### 1. Failed to load config file.

If you get the following error:
```
ERROR com.amazon.hub.counter.samples.Main - Failed to load config file. Could not locate: org.apache.commons.configuration2.io.FileLocator...
```
It's because the configuration file config.properties is not present in the directory of the jar.

##### 2. Max number of retries exceeded.
If the feeds never finish processing, contact Amazon (your assigned Technical Operations Manager or Technical Account Manager) supplying the feedId to help you troubleshoot the issue.
